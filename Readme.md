The goal of this project is to design a **reproducible end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline** to predict household energy consumption using historical electricity usage data.

This project focuses not only on model building, but on **MLOps best practices**, including:

* Data versioning
* Pipeline automation
* Experiment tracking
* Configurable parameters
* Reproducible workflow

---

## 🏭 Domain

**Energy / Power Analytics**

Energy providers use such models to:

* Forecast demand
* Plan resource allocation
* Analyze usage trends
* Detect anomalies

---

## 📂 Dataset

**Household Power Consumption Dataset**

Contains minute-level power usage measurements of a house.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

| Tool             | Purpose                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Python**       | Programming language       |
| **Scikit-Learn** | Machine learning model     |
| **DVC**          | Data & pipeline versioning |
| **MLflow**       | Experiment tracking        |
| **Pandas**       | Data processing            |

## 🤖 Model Used

**Random Forest Regressor**

Why?

* Handles non-linear relationships
* Works well with tabular data
* Robust to noise

---

## 🧪 Experiment Tracking (MLflow)

MLflow tracks:

* Hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth)
* RMSE
* R² score
* Saved model artifacts

To view experiments:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Open in browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## 🔁 Data Versioning & Pipeline Automation (DVC)

DVC ensures:

* Reproducible runs
* Automatic pipeline execution
* Version control for data & models

Run entire pipeline:

```bash
dvc repro
```

---

## ⚙️ Parameters Configuration

All parameters are stored in `params.yaml`:

```yaml
data:
  test_size: 0.2
  random_state: 42

model:
  n_estimators: 80
  max_depth: 12
```

Changing parameters → automatically triggers new experiment.

---

## 📈 Results

| Model Config                 | RMSE       | R²     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| RF (depth=12, estimators=80) | **~0.034** | ~0.999 |

Hyperparameter tuning showed deeper trees and more estimators reduced error.
